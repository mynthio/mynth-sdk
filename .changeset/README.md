# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## How to add a changeset

1. Run `bun changeset` (or `npx changeset`)
2. Select the packages you want to include in the changeset
3. Select the type of change (major, minor, patch)
4. Write a summary of the changes

The changeset will be created in this folder. When you're ready to release, the CI will automatically
create a "Version Packages" PR that updates the version and changelog.
